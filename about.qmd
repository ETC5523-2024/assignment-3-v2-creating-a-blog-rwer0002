<h2>Rachitha Werake</h2>


Hey There!

I am a current student at Monash University, where I am perusing a master
degree in Business Analytics. Before studying my current degree, I completed my
bachelor degree in Business (majoring in project management) at Deakin University. 

Beyond my studies, I have a deep passion for landscape and wildlife photography.
I enjoy spending my time outdoors with my camera, capturing the intricate moments 
that may go unnoticed. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoy getting involved with various
societies and clubs. For example, my time at Deakin University allowed me to 
undertake an executive position for one of the university clubs. 

Feel free to contact me using the the details on the left.
