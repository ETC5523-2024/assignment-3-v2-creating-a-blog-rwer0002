<blog_heading> Problem Description </blog_heading>

Is Agriculture really the main factor to the decline of grasslands birds
in North America?

In first glance, it may seem that agriculture is the culprit to the
decline, especially since that agriculture and industrial farming is
increasingly getting bigger. Additionally, this would also align with
various online journals and reports. For instance, an online journal published
in 2018, states that the increase in agriculture and use of pesticide in
industrial farming is one of the biggest reasons behind the decline in 
grassland/farmland birds (Stanton R.L et al. 2018)

To get the answer to the question, an analysis needs to be done for both
the agriculture/industrial farming in North America and the grassland
bird population.

<blog_heading> Methodology And Data Description </blog_heading>

To get to a conclusion, the following steps were needed to be done.

The first step was to get the necessary data. A survey called [Project
FeederWatch](https://feederwatch.org/about/project-overview/), that is
undertaken by volunteers, records sightings of different species of
birds (Project FeederWatch n.d.). This data can be used to examine the
bird population within North America.

To analyse the changes over time, data for various years were needed to be
downloaded. The Project FeederWatch contains recorded observations from 1988
to 2021. The data from these years were combined into a singular dataset.
Additionally, the dataset with the combined years needed to be filtered to only 
show grassland birds. Moreover, the variable that shows the total population
was renamed to aid in readability. This is shown below.

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
raw_data_2021 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_2021_2024_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
raw_data_2016 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_2016_2020_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
raw_data_2011 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_2011_2015_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 
raw_data_2006 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_2006_2010_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) 
raw_data_2001 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_2001_2005_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
raw_data_1996 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_1996_2000_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
raw_data_1988 <- read_csv("data/PFW_all_1988_1995_May2024_Public.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

raw_data_combined <- rbind(raw_data_1996, raw_data_1988, raw_data_2001, raw_data_2006, raw_data_2011, raw_data_2016, raw_data_2021) %>%
  

options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)

bird_data <- raw_data_combined %>%
  filter(SPECIES_CODE == c("sprpip", "henspa", "graspa", "lecspa", "savspa", "savspa4",
         "ipsspa", "bldspa", "savspa3", "labspa", "wesmea", "mcclon", "grpchi",
         "greprc1", "baispa", "chclon", "shtgro", "lobcur", "larbun", "horlar",
         "horlar3", "horlar1", "sedwre1", "easmea", "easmea2", "dickci", "norbob",
         "norbob1", "x00688", "ferhaw", "burowl", "logshr", "y00620", "casspa", 
         "fiespa", "aplfal", "lilmea2", "comnig", "sonspa", "sonspa2", "swaspa")) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  count(Year) %>%
  ungroup(Year) %>%
  rename("Population" = "n") %>%
  filter(Year > 1999)
```

@tbl-table1 below shows the final data as a table, once the above data preparation
is done. The following variables are included within the final dataset:

-   **Population:**  Total population of grassland birds in North America.
-   **Year:** This variable corresponds to the year in which each observation has occurred.

```{r table1, echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-table1
#| tbl-cap: "Grassland Bird Population - North America"

bird_data %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```

Now, whats next was to find a source of comparison. The production of
livestock and various crops was identified as one of the biggest types
of industrial farming in North America. With this in mind, I was able to
move my attention to find the necessary data. Data from the [Food and
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations
(FAO)](https://www.fao.org/home/en/) records data on how much of various
livestock and crops were produced in North America. Due to the fact that
the raw downloaded file from the FAO consist quite a number of variables, only
the relevant variables were included; these are:

-   **Area:** This variable records the area of each observation. This is fixed to North America only. 
-   **Amount:** Records the total amount (in tonnes) of livestock and crops produced within North America.
-   **Year:** This variable records what year in which each observation has occurred.

Furthermore, to improve readability, the variable that holds the total amount
of production for each year was renamed. 
The above described data preparation is shown below.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
agriculture_data <- read_xls("data/FAOSTAT_data_en_9-6-2024.xls") %>%
  filter(Year > 1999) %>%
  select( "Area", "Year", "Value") %>%
  rename("Amount" = "Value")
```


@tbl-table2 below shows the total production in tonnes for each of the years, from the year
2000 to 2022.

```{r table2, echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-table2
#| tbl-cap: "Production of Livestock and Crops (Tonnes)"
agriculture_data %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  scroll_box(height = "350px")
```

Now at first glance, both @tbl-table1 and @tbl-table2 make it difficult to make 
any meaningful conclusions, due to only showing figures/numbers. Due to this, 
a visual comparision needed to be made, in a form of plots. 

<blog_heading> Analysis </blog_heading>

So, by using R and the various packages within it, a time series plot can be made
for each of the data. The below plots show the plotted data from both Project 
Feeder Watch Survey and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).

```{r fig-figA, fig.cap = "Comparision Of Bird Population And Production Of Livestock And Crops", echo=FALSE}
gridExtra::grid.arrange(plot_1, agriculture_plot)
```

Notice anything interesting from the plots in @fig-figA ? Well upon
first inspection, each of the plots for the production of livestock and
crops, and the population of grassland birds appear to follow a gradual
increasing trend over the years. Now, there are noticeable fluctuations
in both of the plots, with the population of grassland birds
experiencing both a significant inline and decline within its trend, as
shown at the end of the plot.

<blog_heading> Conclusion </blog_heading>

So linking back to the original question on if the growth of
agriculture/industrial farming is the main factor to the decline in
grassland birds in North America, the above plots clearly show that even
though the production of livestock & various crops gradually increase
over the years, there doesn't seem to be a noticeable adverse effect
within the grassland bird population.

Given that the growth of agriculture or industrial farming is not the leading factor to
the decline of grassland birds in North America, what is? Well according
to a news article published on [Virginia
Tech](https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/01/VT_Expert_Bird_Populations.html#),
it states that cats and window collisions is another contributing factor
to the number of bird deaths, with up-to one billion birds dying due to
window collisions, and another 2.4 million deaths due to cats (VIRGINIA TECH 2024).

So what does this all mean? does the growth of agriculture and
industrial farming result in the decline of grasslands birds? Well,
maybe, but for the case of North America, it does not appear to result
in an adverse effect to the bird population. However, as this is only
considering North America, conclusions for other regions cannot be made,
so the growth of agriculture may very well be a leading factor to
decline of grassland birds, just not in North America.
